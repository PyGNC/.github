# PyGNC - Python implementations of Guidance Navigation and Control

Open source implementations of guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) algorithms for small satellites. 

ðŸš§ **Under Construction** ðŸš§


## Style
* Refer to the [MagnetorquerDetumble](https://github.com/PyGNC/MagnetorquerDetumble) repository as a template
* Use expressive names as inputs to functions
* Units at interfaces should be in SI mks (meters-kilogram-seconds); scaling should be internal to individual modules
